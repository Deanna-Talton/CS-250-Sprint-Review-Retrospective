## Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs begins with active engagement with stakeholders to clarify objectives, constraints, and desired outcomes. These needs are translated into functional and non-functional requirements, which are then expressed as **user stories**. User stories provide a concise, user-focused framework that guides development priorities and ensures each feature delivers measurable value to the end user.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to program development emphasizes **iterative delivery**, continuous feedback, and adaptability. I aim to incorporate Agile practices such as **sprint planning**, **daily stand-ups**, **backlog refinement**, and **sprint reviews** into future projects. These processes promote transparency, allow for timely adjustments, and support delivering functional increments that meet evolving requirements.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A strong team member actively contributes to achieving shared objectives by maintaining clear communication, collaborating across disciplines, and upholding accountability for deliverables. This includes demonstrating flexibility when priorities shift, supporting peers in overcoming challenges, and fostering a constructive and respectful team environment that enables collective success.
